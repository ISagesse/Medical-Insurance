# Medical-Insurance

## Analyzing the contributing factor that can lead a to person to pay a high insurance charge.


### the data record the person Age, Sex, BMI, Children, Smoker, Region, Charges.

##### Using csv I was able to store the data into a list, which I called medical_insurances
##### From there I separed the list by age group. By creating a for loop that trought the medical_insurances list add the coresponding list to the list bellow if met the requirement.
- age_group_18_to_25
- age_group_25_to_45 
- age_group_45_plus

##### I created a function call calculate_average that will loop to each each item on the and add all the insurance charges to a temporary variable and divide it by the lenght of the list.

###### I discorver that the older you are the higher your insurance bills will be, people in the group 18 to 25 pay an average of $9087.02, compares to 25yrs to 45yrs that pays $11983.05, and the people that's older than 45yrs pays a average of $17200.43 for insurance.

One can assume that as your age increases so does your insurance bills.
